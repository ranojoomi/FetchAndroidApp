# FetchAndroidApp

## Clarifications

The purpose of this section is to clarify some things regarding the development process.

#### #1 Group by ListId

In the project guidelines it was mentioned to group by listId and to sort by listId then by name. Since sorting by listId first groups the items by lsitId, that was done to achieve the intended results

#### #2 Sort by name

Another requirement was the sorting by name. The names are strings. In the example however, every item is name "Item X" where X represents the id. It was assumed because the names are strings that they by sorted lexicographically, as in real life items will have more descriptive names. As such, "Item 700" will show before "Item 71" as it is lexicographically smaller.

## Project set up

The project was developed using Andriod Studio Girrafe.

#### Step 1: Install Andriod Studio if required

#### Step 2: In the welcome page, click on "Get from VCS"

#### Step 3: Copy and paste https://github.com/ranojoomi/FetchAndroidApp.git into the URL tab, then click clone.

#### Step 4: On the project list, click on the project. It should be named "FetchAndroidApp"

#### Step 5: Wait for a while while the project builds. Once it is done you should be able to click the green play button to run the app. If you have an emulator, you can select it and you should see the list of items pop up on the emulator.

#### Optional: If you run into any errors while building the project simply clean and rebuild the project.

Thanks! I learned a lot doing this and hopefully you enjoy going through it.
